            Get ready for a scavenger hunt across York University! By using this 
            <a href="https://robots-make-art-too.github.io/Group5-_______/">AR portal</a> you will be able to see special
            markers all around the university campus. Although the campus is rather large, these photos taken near the 
            marker locations should make the hunt less tedious. Best of luck!
